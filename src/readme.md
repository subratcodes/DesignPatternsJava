Note : Some of the featurres are in the beta stage. The idea over here is to work on loosely coupled classes and withtime create LLD designs supporting multithreading approach.




# Design Patterns Used
    1. Strategy Pattern for findding the most optimal elevator. Consider the use case where we would need to minimize the waiting time of the passenger.

    2. With stregy pattern you can utulize compositions and have different versions of your algoroitihims been defined. 

    3. The algoriytimhgs can be changed realtime.
