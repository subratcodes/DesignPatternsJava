Requirements

The logging framework should support different log levels, such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL.

It should allow logging messages with a timestamp, log level, and message content.

The framework should support multiple output destinations, such as console, file, and database.

It should provide a configuration mechanism to set the log level and output destination.

The logging framework should be thread-safe to handle concurrent logging from multiple threads.

It should be extensible to accommodate new log levels and output destinations in the future.
